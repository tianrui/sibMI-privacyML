Learning privatized representations of data using Information theoretic measures

### What is this repository for? ###

* Training ML models to learn encodings to provide privacy with respect to sensitive labels
* Comparing and evaluating multiple information theoretic measures (Sibson mutual information, mutual information, KL-divergence, Arimoto mutual information)

### How do I get set up? ###
Install

Tensorflow,
numpy,
matplotlib,
prettytensor,
progressbar,
scipy


* Run synthetic data generation from synth/data_gen.py
* Models for MNIST data can be run from mnist_privacy.py
* FERG data requires downloading the FERG data and preprocessing it with ferg_preproc.py
* Models for FERG data can be run from ferg_privacy.py
